            Trousers (British English), slacks, or pants are an item of clothing
            that may have originated in Central Asia, worn from the waist to the
            ankles, covering both legs separately (rather than with cloth
            extending across both legs as in robes, skirts, and dresses). In the
            United Kingdom, the word pants generally means underwear and not
            trousers.[1] Shorts are similar to trousers, but with legs that come
            down only to around the area of the knee, higher or lower depending
            on the style of the garment. To distinguish them from shorts,
            trousers may be called "long trousers" in certain contexts such as
            school uniform, where tailored shorts may be called "short trousers"
            in the UK.
